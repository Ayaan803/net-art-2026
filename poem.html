<h1>In Your Eyes</h1>
<p>
This piece is inspired by the song <em>In Your Eyes</em>, which explores the idea
of seeing the truth in someones expression even when their words say otherwise.
At night, emotions feel louder, and love feels more fragile &nbsp;especially when
honesty is missing.</p>
<br>
<p>
The story reflects emotional distance and denial.
Someone can smile, laugh, and stay close, yet their eyes reveal
something deeper. <strong>What hurts most is not the ending</strong>,
but the pretending that everything is fine when it clearly is not.
The eyes become a mirror, showing fear, regret, and unspoken truth.</p>
